## Project Title: Analyzing Great Power Competition Between the US and China Through the DIME Framework

### Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the ongoing strategic competition between the United States and China. It explores various elements of power projected by these nations using the DIME framework: Diplomatic, Informational, Military, and Economic. The project includes detailed data visualizations that elucidate the depth and complexity of the influence that these two great powers exert on the global stage.

### Datasets

Three key datasets have been utilized to begin this exploration:

1. Overseas Military Bases (Source: HKU Data Repository)
2. China Global Investment Tracker (Source: American Enterprise Institute)
3. Military Expenditure Database (Source: Stockholm International Peace Research Institute - SIPRI)

These datasets are employed to create visualizations that represent military base distributions, investment patterns, and military expenditure as a share of GDP.

### Requirements

To ensure consistent replication of the data analyses and visualizations, the following Python packages are required:

- `pandas~=2.2.1`: A powerful data manipulation and analysis tool for Python.
- `openpyxl~=3.1.2`: A library to read/write Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files.
- `plotly~=5.20.0`: An interactive graphing library for Python.

These packages should be installed via pip using the `requirements.txt` file included in the project.

### Installation

Clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory. Install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Scripts for data preprocessing and visualization are included. Run each Python script to generate the corresponding visualizations. Ensure you have the necessary data files located in the project directory as indicated by the scripts.
