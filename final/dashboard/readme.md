# Final Project Readme

## Project Title: Analyzing Great Power Competition Between the US and China Through the DIME Framework

### Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the strategic competition between the United States and China, utilizing the DIME (Diplomatic, Informational, Military, Economic) framework. The study leverages advanced data visualizations to illustrate the complex interplay of power and influence these two great powers exert on the global stage.

### Datasets

The project utilizes several key datasets:

1. **Overseas Military Bases** - Source: HKU Data Repository
2. **China Global Investment Tracker** - Source: American Enterprise Institute
3. **Military Expenditure Database** - Source: Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)
4. **World Bank GDP Data** - Source: World Bank
5. **US Alliances and Chinese Partnerships** - Source: Created by the project team based on open-source data

These datasets underpin visualizations that depict distributions of military bases, patterns of investment, and military expenditures relative to GDP.
